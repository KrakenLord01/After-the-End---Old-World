raid_sailing_ship;Raid a Sailing Ship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
raid_sailing_ship_desc;One cannot call themselves a pirate without raiding enemy ships, and now you can have your crew attack a vessel for treasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
pirate_raid;You set out with your crew...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TXT_shore_leave_decision;You decide to take shore leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_shore_leave_1;The dock can be seen from your ship, and as you finally sail into port with your crew, you step onto dry land with a feeling of relief. You intend to make the most of your Shore Leave, and party like only a pirate can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_shore_leave_1;Let's get to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_shore_leave_2;You spend time at the markets and taverns over the next few days, even taking the chance to see performers and fools parade down the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTB_shore_leave_4;I've had worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_shore_leave_5;Heavy drinking can whittle down short fuses, and all it took was some insults and scuffling for a barfight to break out. You wake up in the aftermath of said fight, worse for wear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_shore_leave_5;They got what was coming to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_shore_leave_6;You wake up the next morning surrounded by strangers, remembering that you had been the life of the party the night before. Stories were exchanged, songs were sung, and you made some new buddies thanks to the charismatic properties of alcohol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_shore_leave_6;A fantastic night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC_shore_leave_7;You wake up in an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar room... next to an unfamiliar person. As you struggle to remember what you did last night, you hear a crude-sounding, alcohol-scented voice from the other side of the bed. "Morning there, [Root.GetLadLass]. You wanna go again? I haven't had a tumble that good in ages, and that's really saying something.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_shore_leave_7;A wonderful idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TXT_shore_leave_drunk;You drink and party into the night...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
